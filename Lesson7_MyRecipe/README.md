### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (jQuery is a commonly used cross-browser library. jQuery is not necessary but it requires less code so it leads to simpler code and smaller files.)
2. (Every jQuery statement starts with "$". This means that any code that follows this should be interpreted using jQuery library.)
3. (To select elements you put them in quotes, for example $("h2"). To select a specific class you use "." and to select a specific id you use "#".
