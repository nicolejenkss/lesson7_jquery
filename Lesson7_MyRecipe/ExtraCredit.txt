I first added the display function which displays the ingredients and instructions when they are cicked. Then I added $("ul").children(); which selects the child elements of each element under "ul". I then added $("h3").next().clone().appendTo("script"); which clones the content under h3 and adds it under the article tag. I then added $("h1").after("<center>Best Cookies Ever!!</center>") which added "Best Cookies Ever!!" under the main title.
